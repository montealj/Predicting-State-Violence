# Mass Mobilization: Predicting State Violence

Since the dawn of democracy, protests have played an essential role in maintaining the power of the people. Research indicates  an upwards trend  of the rate of protests world wide. The outcome of a protest can vary between extremes of accommodation to violence with casualties. 
This project aims to create a model that discerns whether a mass mobilization will incur state violence at its inception, to drive protester strategies and inform decisions when dialogue and engagement are no longer an option.
